# Ascii Art
Simple program that will change a image to ascii art


## Grey Scale
Found different algorithms to change image to grey scale
* Luminance: Y = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B
* Mean: Y = (R + G + B) / 3 (would have used this one if didn't fund the others)
* Luma: Y = 0.2126R + 0.7152G + 0.0722B
* Luster: Y = (min(R, G, B) + max(R, G, B))/2

Will have intermidate step to convert images to grey scale, in testing will compare them
